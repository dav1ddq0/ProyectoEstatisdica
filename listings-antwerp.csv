This is followed by an intense flowering period in which several other docks will be excavated.<br />In the 20th century the port activities shift to the North. Most people move away and the Â« Eilandje Â» is a deserted area between port and city.<br /><br />At the end of the 20th century, one can see the potential of the abandoned docks, quays and warehouses. The city writes, together with the organization ""City on the River"" an international architectural competition and in the early 1990s the Spanish architect Manuel de SolÃ -Morales draws an initial plan for The Island. In 1997 RenÃ© Daniel's works out concrete plans for the Old Docks, the Montevideo district and the Cadix district.
